<Q2. Leaders in an array>

Problem Description

Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.

NOTE: The rightmost element is always a leader.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 108


Input Format

There is a single input argument which a integer array A


Output Format

Return an integer array denoting all the leader elements of the array.


Example Input

Input 1:
 A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Input 2:
 A = [5, 4]


Example Output

Output 1:
[17, 2, 5]
Output 2:
[5, 4]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
 Element 17 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 2 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these three elements i.e [17, 2, 5], we can also return [2, 5, 17] or [5, 2, 17] or any other ordering.
Explanation 2:
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 4 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these two elements i.e [5, 4], we can also any other ordering.

 3


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Take the 1st and 2nd elements as they are the minimum and maximum elements respectievly.
Explanation 2:

 Take the last 3 elements of the array.



Expected Output

<Q1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks I>

Problem Description

Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Return the maximum possible profit.



Problem Constraints

0 <= A.size() <= 700000



1 <= A[i] <= 107





Input Format

The first and the only argument is an array of integers, A.


Output Format

Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.


Example Input

Input 1:
A = [1, 2]
Input 2:

A = [1, 4, 5, 2, 4]


Example Output

Output 1:
1
Output 2:

4


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
Buy the stock on day 0, and sell it on day 1.
Explanation 2:

Buy the stock on day 0, and sell it on day 2.



Expected Output
Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases


<Q3. Amazing Subarrays>

You are given a string S, and you have to find all the amazing substrings of S.

An amazing Substring is one that starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U).

Input

Only argument given is string S.
Output

Return a single integer X mod 10003, here X is the number of Amazing Substrings in given the string.
Constraints

1 <= length(S) <= 1e6
S can have special characters
Example

Input
    ABEC

Output
    6

Explanation
    Amazing substrings of given string are :
    1. A
    2. AB
    3. ABE
    4. ABEC
    5. E
    6. EC
    here number of substrings are 6 and 6 % 10003 = 6.
Expected Output

<Q. Bulbs>

Problem Description

A wire connects N light bulbs.


Each bulb has a switch associated with it; however, due to faulty wiring, a switch also changes the state of all the bulbs to the right of the current bulb.

Given an initial state of all bulbs, find the minimum number of switches you have to press to turn on all the bulbs.

You can press the same switch multiple times.

Note: 0 represents the bulb is off and 1 represents the bulb is on.




Problem Constraints

0 <= N <= 5Ã—105
0 <= A[i] <= 1



Input Format

The first and the only argument contains an integer array A, of size N.



Output Format

Return an integer representing the minimum number of switches required.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [0, 1, 0, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 1, 1, 1]


Example Output

Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 press switch 0 : [1 0 1 0]
 press switch 1 : [1 1 0 1]
 press switch 2 : [1 1 1 0]
 press switch 3 : [1 1 1 1]
Explanation 2:

 There is no need to turn any switches as all the bulbs are already on.



Expected Output
Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases

<Pick from both sides!>

Problem Description

You are given an integer array A of size N.

You have to perform B operations. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array A.

Find and return the maximum possible sum of the B elements that were removed after the B operations.

NOTE: Suppose B = 3, and array A contains 10 elements, then you can:

Remove 3 elements from front and 0 elements from the back, OR
Remove 2 elements from front and 1 element from the back, OR
Remove 1 element from front and 2 elements from the back, OR
Remove 0 elements from front and 3 elements from the back.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105

1 <= B <= N

-103 <= A[i] <= 103








Input Format

First argument is an integer array A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the maximum possible sum of elements you removed.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [5, -2, 3 , 1, 2]
 B = 3
Input 2:

 A = [ 2, 3, -1, 4, 2, 1 ]
 B = 4


Example Output

Output 1:
8
Output 2:
9


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Remove element 5 from front and element (1, 2) from back so we get 5 + 1 + 2 = 8
Explanation 2:
 Remove the first element and the last 3 elements. So we get 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9
